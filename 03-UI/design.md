# Shipyard UI Design System

Status: Approved working direction  
Theme: Harbor Amber  
Last updated: 2026-08-01

This document defines the visual foundation and starter component rules for Shipyard. The editable source of truth is [`shipyard.pen`](./shipyard.pen); the logo and social identity source is [`shipyard-logo-system.pen`](./shipyard-logo-system.pen).

## 1. Design direction

Shipyard is a focused project-management product. Its interface should feel operational, calm and dependable rather than decorative.

The system follows five principles:

1. **Clarity before decoration.** Hierarchy comes from typography, spacing and borders.
2. **Compact, not cramped.** Dense views remain readable and easy to scan.
3. **Warm precision.** Amber identifies the brand and important actions without overwhelming the workspace.
4. **Meaning beyond color.** Statuses also use labels, icons and structural changes.
5. **Reusable by default.** Product screens should use the documented tokens and components instead of one-off values.

## 2. Brand assets

The Precision Loop mark is the Shipyard symbol. The logo system file remains the source of truth for its geometry.

- Use the favicon/app mark in compact product locations such as the application header, browser icon and avatar-sized brand placements.
- Use the horizontal or stacked lockup only when the wordmark is necessary.
- Do not redraw, rotate, stretch or change the proportions of the mark.
- Use the Harbor Amber brand color on light surfaces and the white mark inside an amber container for the favicon/app icon.

## 3. Color system

### Foundation colors

| Token | Value | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `ds-bg` | `#F4F3EF` | Application canvas and page background |
| `ds-surface` | `#FFFFFF` | Primary cards, panels and controls |
| `ds-surface-subtle` | `#FBFAF7` | Table headers and quiet nested surfaces |
| `ds-sidebar` | `#161512` | Dark navigation and high-contrast regions |
| `ds-text` | `#171717` | Primary text and icons |
| `ds-text-muted` | `#6C6861` | Secondary copy, metadata and placeholders |
| `ds-border` | `#DEDCD5` | Default borders and dividers |
| `ds-border-strong` | `#B9B5AC` | Emphasized boundaries |

### Brand colors

| Token | Value | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `ds-brand` | `#B45309` | Primary actions, active states and brand mark |
| `ds-accent` | `#F59E0B` | Focus, highlights and dark-surface accents |
| `ds-brand-soft` | `#FFF4DB` | Selected rows, tags and tinted brand surfaces |
| `ds-focus` | `#F59E0B` | Keyboard focus ring |

`ds-brand` is the canonical implementation token. Any `brand-primary` variable copied with brand artwork is a compatibility alias and should not be used in product code.

### Semantic colors

| State | Foreground | Background | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Success | `ds-success` — `#2E7D5B` | `ds-success-soft` — `#EAF5EF` | On track, saved |
| Warning | `ds-warning` — `#A65F00` | `ds-warning-soft` — `#FFF1D6` | At risk, capacity warning |
| Danger | `ds-danger` — `#B42318` | `ds-danger-soft` — `#FDECEA` | Blocked, destructive action |
| Info | `ds-info` — `#2563EB` | `ds-info-soft` — `#EAF2FF` | Planned, informational |

Neutral states use `ds-text-muted` on a quiet neutral surface such as `#F0EFEB`.

### Color usage

- Reserve solid `ds-brand` for the most important action or selected control in a section.
- Use `ds-brand-soft` for selection and emphasis without implying an action.
- Use semantic colors only for their documented meaning.
- Never communicate status with color alone.
- Normal text must reach at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio.

## 4. Typography

### Font families

| Token | Family | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `ds-font-ui` | Inter | Headings, body text, controls and navigation |
| `ds-font-mono` | Geist Mono | Labels, IDs, statuses, metadata and compact numeric data |

The Shipyard wordmark uses Geist as defined in the logo system; it is not a general interface font.

### Product type scale

| Style | Size | Weight | Line height | Typical use |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Display | 40px | 700 | 1.08 | Product moments and major empty states |
| Heading 1 | 32px | 650 | 1.15 | Page title |
| Heading 2 | 24px | 650 | 1.20 | Major page section |
| Heading 3 | 20px | 600 | 1.25 | Card or panel heading |
| Body | 14px | 400 | 1.50 | Default product copy |
| Small | 12px | 400 | 1.50 | Supporting text and metadata |
| System label | 9–11px | 600–700 | 1.35 | Uppercase labels and statuses |

### Typography rules

- Use sentence case for product copy, navigation and controls.
- Use uppercase Geist Mono sparingly for system labels.
- Give uppercase mono labels generous letter spacing, generally `0.7–1.5px`.
- Prefer verbs and concrete nouns: “Create task,” “Assign owner,” “Move to sprint.”
- Keep headings short enough to scan without wrapping when possible.

## 5. Spacing

Shipyard uses a 4px base unit.

| Token | Value | Common use |
|---|---:|---|
| `ds-space-1` | 4px | Micro alignment |
| `ds-space-2` | 8px | Icon-to-label gaps, compact groups |
| `ds-space-3` | 12px | Button groups and control spacing |
| `ds-space-4` | 16px | Form stacks and dense card padding |
| `ds-space-5` | 20px | Medium internal spacing |
| `ds-space-6` | 24px | Sections, standard card padding |
| `ds-space-8` | 32px | Page padding and major sections |
| `ds-space-10` | 40px | Large separation |
| `ds-space-12` | 48px | Large composition spacing |
| `ds-space-16` | 64px | Major page separation only |

Do not introduce arbitrary spacing values when an existing token can express the relationship.

## 6. Layout and density

- Use a 12-column product grid.
- Default column gutter: 24px.
- Default page inset: 32px.
- Sidebar width: 240–272px.
- Main content is fluid with a recommended maximum width of 1440px.
- Major page sections use 24–32px vertical spacing.
- Cards use 16px padding for dense data and 24px for narrative or form content.
- Form field groups use 16px vertical spacing.
- Button and toolbar groups use 8–12px gaps.
- Dense table rows use 44px; comfortable or summary rows may use 52px.

## 7. Shape

### Radius scale

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---:|---|
| None | 0px | Tables and edge-to-edge structures |
| `ds-radius-sm` | 4px | Small checks and compact details |
| `ds-radius-md` | 8px | Buttons, inputs and navigation items |
| `ds-radius-lg` | 12px | Cards and panels |
| `ds-radius-xl` | 16px | Large panels and elevated containers |
| `ds-radius-pill` | 999px | Statuses, filters and compact pills only |

Avoid making every container a pill or using large radii on dense data structures.

### Borders and focus

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---:|---|
| `ds-border-thin` | 1px | Default boundary and divider |
| `ds-border-strong-width` | 2px | Emphasized state or boundary |
| Focus ring | 3px amber | Visible keyboard focus around interactive controls |

Borders provide the default surface hierarchy. Use shadows only when an element genuinely floats over another layer.

## 8. Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Level 0 | No shadow | Canvas and embedded surfaces |
| Level 1 | `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` | Resting cards when a border is insufficient |
| Level 2 | `0 8px 24px -4px rgba(0,0,0,0.16)` | Popovers, dropdowns and floating layers |

Do not stack borders, strong shadows and tinted fills unless the interaction requires all three.

## 9. Sizing and iconography

### Controls

| Token | Height | Usage |
|---|---:|---|
| `ds-control-sm` | 32px | Dense tables and secondary toolbars |
| `ds-control-md` | 36px | Default product control |
| `ds-control-lg` | 44px | Primary forms and touch-friendly actions |

### Icons

Use Lucide outline icons throughout the product.

| Token | Size | Usage |
|---|---:|---|
| `ds-icon-sm` | 14px | Metadata and compact statuses |
| `ds-icon-md` | 18px | Buttons and standard controls |
| `ds-icon-lg` | 24px | Navigation landmarks and larger actions |

- Use one icon style per screen.
- Pair unfamiliar icons with text.
- Keep icons optically centered rather than forcing identical visual weight.

## 10. Interaction states

### Primary button

| State | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Default | `ds-brand` background with white content |
| Hover | Darken to `#9A4807` |
| Pressed | Darken to `#7C3A06` |
| Focus | Default button plus visible 3px `ds-focus` ring |
| Disabled | `#E8E5DE` background and `#9B968D` content |

### Inputs

| State | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Default | White surface with `ds-border` |
| Focus | 2px `ds-focus` border |
| Error | `ds-danger-soft` surface with `ds-danger` border and message |
| Disabled | `#F0EFEB` surface with muted content |

### Selection

- Active navigation: dark amber tint with amber text and icon.
- Selected row: `ds-brand-soft` plus a check or other explicit selection cue.
- Active filter: solid brand treatment when it represents an applied action.

## 11. Component library

The following starter components exist as reusable elements in `shipyard.pen`:

### Actions

- `Button / Primary` — one main action per section.
- `Button / Secondary` — supportive brand-tinted action.
- `Button / Outline` — tertiary action such as Export or Cancel.
- `Button / Ghost` — inline or low-priority action.
- `Button / Destructive` — irreversible or harmful action.
- `Button / Icon` — familiar actions with an accessible label.

### Forms

- `Input / Text`
- `Input / Search`
- `Input / Select`
- `Checkbox / Checked`
- `Toggle / On`
- `Progress / Default`

Inputs require a visible label unless an equivalent accessible label is provided by the implementation.

### Navigation

- Active and default sidebar navigation items
- `Tabs / Default`

Use one active item per navigation level. Tabs switch between peer views; they should not trigger unrelated actions.

### Feedback

- `Alert / Success`
- `Alert / Warning`
- `Alert / Danger`

Alerts must include an icon and direct message. Provide an action only when the user can resolve or inspect the condition.

### Data display

- `Card / Project Summary`
- `Table / Projects`

Cards should contain one primary idea. Tables must follow the structure `Table → Row → Cell → Content`, use 4–7 columns when possible and keep numeric data aligned consistently.

## 12. Accessibility guardrails

- Maintain at least 4.5:1 contrast for normal text.
- Never rely on color alone for status, selection or validation.
- Preserve visible keyboard focus on every interactive element.
- Use 44px targets where touch interaction is likely.
- Provide accessible names for icon-only controls.
- Keep heading levels sequential.
- Connect errors to the relevant field and explain how to fix them.
- Respect reduced-motion preferences when motion is introduced.

## 13. Content style

- Use plain, direct language.
- Lead actions with verbs.
- Prefer “Project name is required” over “Invalid input.”
- Keep status labels concise: “On track,” “At risk,” “Blocked,” “Planned.”
- Use consistent nouns across navigation, tables and forms.
- Avoid technical language unless the user is working in a technical context.

## 14. Implementation checklist

Before a screen is considered ready:

- It uses the documented `ds-*` tokens.
- It follows the typography hierarchy.
- Spacing values come from the 4px scale.
- There is one clearly dominant action per section.
- Hover, pressed, focus, disabled, loading, empty and error states are considered.
- Status is understandable without color.
- Text and controls meet contrast and target-size requirements.
- Reusable components are used before creating new variants.
- Layout works at the intended dashboard widths without clipping or overlap.

## 15. Governance

Update the Pencil design system first when changing a shared visual decision. Once the canvas direction is approved, update this document in the same change.

New tokens or component variants must solve a recurring product need. Avoid adding a new value when an existing token or component can be reused.
